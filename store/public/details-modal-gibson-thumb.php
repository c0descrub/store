                            <p class="product-description">No specific Gibson model carries more intrigue and gravitas than the 1959 Les Paul Standard. It wasn't a successful model when it was released (under 650 were made) but before long it was adopted by some of the world's greatest guitarists -- Jimmy Page, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Duane Allman, Mike Bloomfield, and Billy Gibbons, to name a few.<br><br>The instrument was simply enchanting, from its beautiful figured maple top to its extreme sonic versatility. "It has a deep, powerful sound and you can use it to imitate just about anything – violin, sax, cello, even a sitar," says Jeff Beck.<br><br>All these reasons and more made the 1959 Les Paul Standard the most coveted and legendary guitar on the planet.</p>
