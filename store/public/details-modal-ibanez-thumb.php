                            <h4>Product Overview</h4>
                            <p class="product-description">With its continued popularity, Ibanez has been keeping a constant effort to improve the SR series, answering the wider needs of a variety of players at a variety of budgets. Ibanez is now proud to announce huge upgrades to the SR370 series. The PDC pickups with exposed pole pieces provide high output with more clarity than ever. A 3-way power tap switch on the Ibanez Custom Electronics 3-band EQ creates 3 tonal options; Humbucking, Single coil, and Low-end enhanced single coil. This allows for much more versatility. Along with the new upgraded tonal options, the great staples of the SR line have been preserved; smooth and fast neck, lightweight body and supreme comfortability. All of these specs combine to create a truly impressive bass available at a great price.</p>
